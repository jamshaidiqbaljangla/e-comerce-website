## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare for Hosting
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/jamshaid/Desktop/Untitled Folder/website"

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Test locally
node server-sqlite.js
```

### Step 2: Files to Upload to Host
Upload these files/folders to your hosting provider:
```
📁 Root Directory/
├── 📄 server-sqlite.js (main server file)
├── 📄 package.json
├── 📄 database.sqlite (your database)
├── 📄 setup-database-simple.js (database setup)
├── 📄 index.html
├── 📄 admin.html
├── 📄 [all other .html files]
├── 📁 css/ (all stylesheets)
├── 📁 js/ (all JavaScript files)
├── 📁 images/ (all images)
├── 📁 uploads/ (for user uploads)
└── 📁 node_modules/ (dependencies)
```

### Step 3: Hosting Configuration
For most hosting providers (Heroku, Railway, Vercel, etc.):

1.  **Set start script** in `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node server-sqlite.js"
    }
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in your root directory and add the following variables. **Do not commit this file to version control.**
    ```
    # Server Port
    PORT=3001

    # Set to 'production' for deployment
    NODE_ENV=production

    # A strong, unique secret for signing JWTs
    JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-and-long-random-jwt-key

    # The production URL of your frontend application
    PRODUCTION_URL=https://yourdomain.com
    ```

3.  **Domain Configuration**:
    The `server-sqlite.js` is now configured to automatically use the `PRODUCTION_URL` from your environment variables for CORS. Ensure this value is set correctly.

### Step 4: Security Best Practices
-   **JWT Secret**: Ensure the `JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` file is a long, complex, and randomly generated string.
-   **HTTPS**: Your hosting provider should be configured to use HTTPS.
-   **Environment Variables**: Never expose your `.env` file publicly.
-   **Admin Credentials**: Change the default admin password immediately after the first login.

## 🎯 Admin Access
- **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/admin.html`
- **Login**: admin@bingo.com
- **Password**: admin123
- **Change password** after first login!
