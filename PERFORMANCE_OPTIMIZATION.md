# BINGO E-commerce Performance Optimization Guide

This document provides instructions and best practices for optimizing the performance of the BINGO e-commerce platform.

## Performance Improvements Implemented

Based on Lighthouse audit results, the following optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Server-side Optimizations**
   - Enhanced compression with optimal settings
   - Improved caching for static assets
   - Security headers with optimized CSP policy
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **CSS Loading Optimizations**
   - Critical CSS loaded immediately
   - Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously
   - Proper preloading and connection hints

3. **JavaScript Optimizations**
   - Script bundling and priority loading
   - Deferred non-critical JavaScript
   - Optimized dependency management

4. **Image Optimizations**
   - Lazy loading for images
   - WebP and AVIF format generation
   - Responsive image sizes for different devices

## How to Use These Optimizations

### Build and Optimize Assets

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Install Sharp for image optimization
npm install sharp --save-dev

# Run optimization scripts
npm run optimize

# Optimize images (after installing Sharp)
node scripts/optimize-images.js

# Build and start the optimized site
npm run build
```

### Additional Optimization Tips

1. **Image Best Practices**
   - Always include width/height attributes on images to prevent layout shifts
   - Use responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes
   - Replace animated GIFs with videos where possible

2. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Regularly audit and remove unused JavaScript
   - Split code by routes/features for code-splitting
   - Use the browser's Performance tab to identify bottlenecks

3. **CSS Optimization**
   - Remove unused CSS with tools like PurgeCSS
   - Consider using CSS-in-JS for component-scoped styles
   - Minimize CSS specificity and nesting

4. **Server Optimization**
   - Enable HTTP/2 in production
   - Set up a CDN for static assets
   - Configure proper CORS settings

## Monitoring Performance

- Regularly run Lighthouse audits
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Use real user monitoring (RUM) in production

## Further Optimization Suggestions

1. **Consider Server-Side Rendering** for improved initial load time
2. **Implement Service Workers** for offline capabilities and faster repeat visits
3. **Use Web Components** for better encapsulation and performance
4. **Optimize Third-Party Scripts** - defer or lazy-load where possible
5. **Use Resource Hints** (preconnect, prefetch, preload) strategically
